# jupyter-portable-kernel-installer
Install additional kernels to [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/) with Notebooks 

After installing WinPython to an USB drive, these Python3 Notebooks can be used to install additional kernels.
Since the drive letter of the USB drive may change, some configurations are changed to relative paths.

Currently available kernels:
Julia
Octave
R

The silent installation of scilab does not work yet.
