# jupyter-portable-kernel-installer
Install additional kernels to [Jupyter Portable (for Windows)](https://www.portabledevapps.net/jupyter-portable.php) with Notebooks 

After installing Jupyter Portable to an USB drive, these Python3 Notebooks can be used to install additional kernels.
Since the drive letter of the USB drive may change, some configurations are changed to relative paths.

Currently available kernels:
Julia
Octave
R
scilab

Hint: The "jupyter-portable.exe" with the tray icon does not work on my machine. Starting JupyterLab with "apps/scripts/jupyter-lab.bat" works.
